# Connect 5
Connect 5, a variation of the famous Connect Four game, is a two-player connection game
in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the
top into a nine-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down,
occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the
first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of five of one's own discs.

This program utilises a server-client architecture, allowing 2 clients to play against each other in a pliantext version of the game. 

## How to run:

Download all files and place into a Java Project. Run the Server.java file to start the server, before running the Client.java, once for each of the two players. Follow the instructions given to the client using standard input.
